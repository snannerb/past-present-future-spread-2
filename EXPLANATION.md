**Here you can check all the code explanation.**

Letâ€™s break down the **"Past Present Future Spread" web app** in detail, explaining each file, block of code, and its purpose. Iâ€™ll also highlight important aspects, caveats, and possible improvements.

---

### **Folder Structure**
```
/past-present-future-spread/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js
â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ card1.jpg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ card2.jpg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ card3.jpg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ placeholder.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore
```

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file for the web app.
- **`styles.css`**: The CSS file for styling the web app.
- **`script.js`**: The JavaScript file for functionality.
- **`images/`**: Contains tarot card images used in the app.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation on how to run and deploy the app.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files/folders to ignore when using Git.

---

### **1. HTML (`index.html`)**
This file defines the structure of the web app.

#### Key Features:
- **`DOCTYPE` and `html` tag**: Declares the document type and language.
- **`meta` tags**: Ensure proper character encoding (`UTF-8`) and responsive design (`viewport`).
- **`link` tags**:
  - Link to `styles.css` for styling.
  - Link to Google Fonts for retro font (`Press Start 2P`).
- **`header`**: Displays the app title (`Past Present Future Spread`).
- **`main`**:
  - Contains three `div`s for Past, Present, and Future cards.
  - Each `div` has:
    - A heading (`h2`) for the card label.
    - An `img` tag for the card image (initially set to `placeholder.jpg`).
    - A `p` tag for the card description.
  - A `button` with the ID `drawButton` to draw new cards.
- **`footer`**: Includes a link to an external site (`Pixel Oracle`).
- **`script` tag**: Links to `script.js` for interactivity.

#### Why is it important?
- Itâ€™s the appâ€™s foundation, defining its structure and content.
- Includes accessibility features like `aria-label` for screen readers.
- Links to external resources (CSS, fonts, JavaScript).

#### Caveats:
- The `img` tags use `placeholder.jpg` initially. Ensure the images load correctly.
- The `alt` attribute in `img` tags is essential for accessibility but lacks dynamic content.

#### Possible Improvements:
- Add a loading state for images to improve user experience.
- Dynamically update `alt` text based on the drawn card for better accessibility.

---

### **2. CSS (`styles.css`)**
This file styles the web app.

#### Key Features:
- **Font**: Uses retro-style font (`Press Start 2P`).
- **Layout**:
  - Centers content with `text-align: center`.
  - Uses `flexbox` to arrange cards in a row.
  - Cards are set to 30% width by default, adjusting with media queries for smaller screens.
- **Card Styling**:
  - Adds a border to card images.
  - Uses responsive font sizes for headings and descriptions.
- **Button Styling**:
  - Changes background color on hover for interactivity.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Adjusts card width for tablets (45%) and mobile devices (100%).

#### Why is it important?
- Ensures the app looks visually appealing and functions well on different devices.
The retro font and layout give the app a unique style.
- The responsive design enhances accessibility and usability.

#### Caveats:
- The fixed card height might cause layout issues if card images have different aspect ratios.
- The retro font might not be legible for all users.

#### Possible Improvements:
- Use CSS Grid for more flexible card layouts.
- Add a fallback font in case `Press Start 2P` fails to load.

### **3. JavaScript (`script.js`)**
This file adds interactivity to the app.

#### Key Features:
- **`tarotCards` Array**: Stores objects with card images and descriptions.
- **`drawCards` Function**:
  - Shuffles the `tarotCards` array randomly using `Math.random()`.
  - Selects the first three cards after shuffling.
  - Updates the `img` and `description` elements for each card.
- **Event Listeners**:
  - Draws cards on page load (`DOMContentLoaded`).
  - Draws cards when the `Draw Cards` button is clicked.

#### Why is it important?
- Handles the core functionality of the app: drawing and displaying cards.
- Ensures the app is interactive and engaging.

#### Caveats:
- The shuffling logic (`Math.random() - 0.5`) is simple but not cryptographically secure.
- The card array is static and limited. Adding more cards requires manual updates.

#### Possible Improvements:
- Use a more robust shuffling algorithm (e.g., [Fisher-Yates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle)).
- Fetch card data from an external API for dynamic content.
- Add animations for card transitions.

---

### **4. Images**
Placeholder and tarot card images stored in the `images/` folder.

#### Key Features:
- **`placeholder.jpg`**: Shown before cards are drawn.
- **`card1.jpg`, `card2.jpg`, `card3.jpg`**: Tarot card images used in the app.

#### Why is it important?
- Visual elements are crucial for a tarot card app.
- The images enhance the user experience and make the app more engaging.

#### Caveats:
- The app currently assumes a fixed set of card images. Ensure all images are properly named and located.
- Large image files may slow down the appâ€™s performance.

#### Possible Improvements:
- Optimize images for faster loading (e.g., compress or use WebP format).
- Add more cards for variety.

---

### **5. README.md**
Provides instructions for running and deploying the app.

#### Key Features:
- Explains how to run the app locally.
- Mentions deployment options (GitHub Pages, Netlify).

#### Why is it important?
- Helps others understand and use the app.
- Essential for open-source projects and collaboration.

#### Caveats:
- Assumes basic familiarity with Git and web development.
- Lacks detailed troubleshooting steps.

#### Possible Improvements:
- Add a section on using a local development server (e.g., `live-server`).
- Include troubleshooting tips for common issues.

---

### **6. `.gitignore`**
Specifies files/folders to ignore in Git.

#### Key Features:
- Ignores `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store` files.

#### Why is it important?
- Prevents unnecessary files from being tracked by Git.
- Keeps the repository clean and focused.

#### Caveats:
- Assumes the user is using Git for version control.
- Doesnâ€™t account for other development environments (e.g., Python virtual environments).

#### Possible Improvements:
- Add common ignore patterns for other environments/tools.

---

### **How to Run the App**
1. **Download Files**:
   - Create the folder structure and files as described.
   - Place tarot card images in the `images/` folder.
2. **Open in Browser**:
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. **Interact**:
   - Click the "Draw Cards" button to shuffle and display new cards.

---

### **Final Notes**
- The app is fully functional, accessible, and responsive.
- Replace placeholder images and descriptions with your actual tarot card data.
- Add more cards to the `tarotCards` array for variety.
- Deploy it using GitHub Pages or Netlify for public access.
